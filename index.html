                    &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Before diving into instructions, this study is meant to be done on a 
                    desktop or laptop computer. It may not work as intended on a mobile device. </b><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; This study will ask you to select a square on a grid as fast as possible. 
                    After clicking the "Begin" button below, a grid of colored squares will be
                    shown after a countdown. The objective is to click on that off-colored 
                    square as quick as possible. If there is no off-colored square, or you don't
                    think there is any off colored square, a "no outlier" button is available to 
                    also click as quick as possible. The study will consist of two sections.
                    The first section will consist of 60 total grids which may vary the color 
                    of a single square. The first 48 of these will have gaps between 
                    the squares like the sample image, and the last 12 will not have gaps between 
                    the squares. The second part of the study will consist of 36 total grids and 
                    may vary more than one square with more than one color. The goal for the second
                    part is to pick out the one that stands out the most to you, or say there is 
                    no outlier. The first 24 will have gaps between the squares, and the next 12
                    will not have gaps. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the study, your responses will be timed and recorded.
                    At the end of the study, these times will be recorded, you will be asked to
                    enter your name, and a link to a google form will be shown to conduct a short
                    questionaire. If you wish to see any of the data or information that was being 
                    recorded, please contact Lauren Oliver at olive381@umn.edu
